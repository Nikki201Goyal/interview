## Project Setup Instructions

### Connecting .env File with the Database

1. Open the project folder in your preferred code editor.
2. Look for a file named `.env.example` in the root directory of the project.
3. Rename the file from `.env.example` to just `.env`.
4. Open the `.env` file and fill in the necessary database connection details. It should look something like this:


Replace `your_database_host`, `your_database_port`, `your_database_name`, `your_database_username`, and `your_database_password` with your actual database credentials.

### Running Migrations

To set up the database tables required for the project, run the following command in the terminal:


This will create all the required tables in the database according to the migration files defined in the project.

## Insights and Analysis

In this project, I have performed some analysis based on gender, location, node, and source, using the test parameters.
